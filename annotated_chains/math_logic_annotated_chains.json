Hmm, induction is a method where I prove a base case and then show that if it's true for some integer k, it's also true for k+1. Let me try to remember how that works.\n\nFirst, the base case. For n=1, the sum of the first 1 positive integer is just 1. Let's see what the formula gives: 1*(1+1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. Okay, that checks out. So the base case is true.\n\nNow, for the inductive step. I need to assume that the formula holds for some arbitrary positive integer k. That is, I assume that 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2. Then, I have to show that the formula holds for k+1, which is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k+1).\n\nLet me write that out: sum up to k is k(k+1)/2, so sum up to k+1 is that sum plus (k+1). So, sum up to k+1 = k(k+1)/2 + (k+1). Hmm, maybe I can factor out (k+1) from both terms. Let's see:\n\nk(k+1)/2 + (k+1) = (k+1)*(k/2 + 1) = (k+1)*(k + 2)/2. Because k/2 + 1 is the same as (k + 2)/2.

    "reasoning_chain": "\nOkay, so I need to prove that \u221a2 is irrational using proof by contradiction. Hmm, I remember that irrational numbers are numbers which cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers, right? So, if \u221a2 were rational, that would mean it can be written as a fraction a/b where a and b are integers and b is not zero. But since \u221a2 is irrational, that can't be the case. So, maybe I can assume the opposite and then show that this leads to a contradiction.\n\nAlright, let's start by assuming the opposite of what we want to prove. That is, let's suppose that \u221a2 is rational. If it is rational, then it can be written as a fraction a/b where a and b are integers with no common factors other than 1 (because if they had common factors, we could simplify the fraction). So, I can write:\n\n\u221a2 = a/b\n\nwhere a and b are coprime integers (they have no common divisors other than 1) and b is positive. Now, if I square both sides of this equation, I should get:\n\n(\u221a2)^2 = (a/b)^2\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n2 = a\u00b2 / b\u00b2\n\nThen, multiplying both sides by b\u00b2 gives:\n\n2b\u00b2 = a\u00b2\n\nSo, 2 times b squared equals a squared. Hmm, this implies that a\u00b2 is even because it's 2 times something. If a\u00b2 is even, then a must also be even. Because if you square an odd number, you get an odd number, right? For example, 3\u00b2 is 9, which is odd. So, if a is even, then a can be written as 2k, where k is some integer.\n\nLet me substitute a with 2k in the equation 2b\u00b2 = a\u00b2:\n\n2b\u00b2 = (2k)\u00b2\n2b\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2\n\nNow, dividing both sides by 2:\n\nb\u00b2 = 2k\u00b2\n\nSo, b squared equals 2 times k squared.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the original statement to make it clearer. The statement is: For all real numbers x, if x\u00b2 > 4, then x > 2 or x < -2. In logical terms, this can be written as:\n\n\u2200x \u2208 \u211d, (x\u00b2 > 4 \u2192 (x > 2 \u2228 x < -2)).\n\nAlright, so the original statement is a universal statement because it starts with \"for all real numbers x.\" It also has an implication: if x squared is greater than 4, then x is either greater than 2 or less than -2. \n\nNow, I need to find the negation of this statement. Remember, the negation of a universal statement is an existential statement. That is, \u00ac\u2200x P(x) is equivalent to \u2203x \u00acP(x).

I recall that an implication P \u2192 Q is equivalent to \u00acP \u2228 Q. So, the negation of P \u2192 Q is P \u2227 \u00acQ. That means the implication is false exactly when P is true and Q is false. \n\nSo, applying that to our implication, the negation of (x\u00b2 > 4 \u2192 (x > 2 \u2228 x < -2)) is: x\u00b2 > 4 and it is not the case that (x > 2 \u2228 x < -2). \n\nHmm, but if x\u00b2 > 4, then x must satisfy either x > 2 or x < -2 because x\u00b2 > 4 implies that |x| > 2.

Hmm, I've heard about this proof before, maybe it's the Euclid-Euler theorem or something like that. Let me try to recall and figure it out step by step.\n\nAlright, the idea is to assume the opposite of what we want to prove. So, if we assume that there are only finitely many prime numbers, let's say there are primes p\u2081, p\u2082, p\u2083, ..., p\u2099. Then, we need to find a contradiction from this assumption.\n\nOkay, so if there are only finitely many primes, we can list them all out. That makes sense because if it's finite, we can enumerate them. Then, the next step is to consider the smallest prime in this list, right? Let's call that p. Now, I think we need to construct a number by multiplying all these primes together and then adding one. So, the number would be p\u2081p\u2082...p\u2099 + 1. Let me write that down.\n\nLet N = p\u2081p\u2082...p\u2099 + 1.\n\nNow, the crucial part is to show that N is either a new prime or a composite number that isn't divisible by any of the primes in our list. If N is prime, then that contradicts our assumption that p\u2081 through p\u2099 are all the primes. If N is composite, then it must have a prime factor, and that prime factor can't be in our original list because we multiplied all of them together. Therefore, either way, we get a contradiction.\n\nWait, let me make sure I understand why N can't be divisible by any of the primes p\u2081 to p\u2099. If N were divisible by, say, p\u2081, then p\u2081 would divide N. But N is p\u2081p\u2082...p\u2099 + 1, so when we divide N by p\u2081, the remainder would be 1. That means p\u2081 doesn't divide N. Similarly, the same logic applies to all the other primes p\u2082, ..., p\u2099. So, none of them can divide N.

    "reasoning_chain": "\nOkay, so I need to use mathematical induction to prove that for all positive integers n, 2\u207f is greater than n. Hmm, I've heard about induction before, but I'm not entirely sure how it works. Let me try to recall. \n\nFrom what I remember, mathematical induction has two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. The base case is where you prove the statement is true for the initial value, usually n=1. Then, the inductive step is where you assume it's true for some arbitrary positive integer k, and then prove it must also be true for k+1. \n\nSo, let me start with the base case. For n=1, I need to check if 2\u00b9 > 1. Calculating 2\u00b9 is 2, and 2 is indeed greater than 1. So, the base case holds. That was straightforward.\n\nNow, moving on to the inductive step. I need to assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k. That is, I'll assume that 2\u1d4f > k. This is my induction hypothesis. \n\nThe next part is to prove that 2\u1d4f\u207a\u00b9 > k+1. To do this, I should try to express 2\u1d4f\u207a\u00b9 in terms of 2\u1d4f. I know that 2\u1d4f\u207a\u00b9 is equal to 2 * 2\u1d4f. So, let me write that down: 2\u1d4f\u207a\u00b9 = 2 * 2\u1d4f.\n\nNow, from my induction hypothesis, I know that 2\u1d4f > k. If I multiply both sides of this inequality by 2, which is a positive number, the direction of the inequality should remain the same. So, multiplying both sides by 2 gives me 2 * 2\u1d4f > 2 * k, which simplifies to 2\u1d4f\u207a\u00b9 > 2k.\n\nAlright, so now I have that 2\u1d4f\u207a\u00b9 > 2k. But I need to show that 2\u1d4f\u207a\u00b9 > k+1. So, is 2k greater than k+1? Let's see. If I subtract k from both sides of 2k > k+1, I get k > 1. Hmm, that means",

    "annotated_chain": "[\"initializing\"]Okay, so I need to prove that for any integers a and b, if a squared plus b squared is odd, then exactly one of a or b is odd. Hmm, let me think about how squares behave with even and odd numbers.[\"end-section\"]\n\n[\"adding-knowledge\"]First, I remember that when you square an even number, the result is even, and when you square an odd number, the result is odd.[\"end-section\"] [\"deduction\"]Let me write that down:\n\n- If a is even, then a\u00b2 is even.\n- If a is odd, then a\u00b2 is odd.\n\nSame goes for b.[\"end-section\"]\n\n[\"adding-knowledge\"]So, the sum a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 is odd. Let me recall that the sum of two numbers is odd only if one is even and the other is odd. Because even + odd = odd, and odd + even = odd. If both are even, even + even = even, and if both are odd, odd + odd = even.[\"end-section\"] [\"deduction\"]So, yeah, that seems right.[\"end-section\"]\n\n[\"deduction\"]So, if a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 is odd, then one of a\u00b2 or b\u00b2 must be even, and the other must be odd. Because if both were even, their sum would be even, and if both were odd, their sum would also be even. So, only one can be even, and the other must be odd.[\"end-section\"]\n\n[\"deduction\"]Wait, so that means one of a or b is odd, and the other is even. Because a\u00b2 is even only if a is even, and a\u00b2 is odd only if a is odd. So, if a\u00b2 is even, then a must be even, and if a\u00b2 is odd, then a must be odd.[\"end-section\"]\n\n[\"deduction\"]So, putting it all together, if a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 is odd, then exactly one of a or b is odd.

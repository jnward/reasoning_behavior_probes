    "reasoning_chain": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to prove by induction that the sum of the first n positive integers is equal to n(n+1)/2. Hmm, induction is a method where I prove a base case and then show that if it's true for some integer k, it's also true for k+1. Let me try to remember how that works.\n\nFirst, the base case. For n=1, the sum of the first 1 positive integer is just 1. Let's see what the formula gives: 1*(1+1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. Okay, that checks out. So the base case is true.\n\nNow, for the inductive step. I need to assume that the formula holds for some arbitrary positive integer k. That is, I assume that 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2. Then, I have to show that the formula holds for k+1, which is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k+1).\n\nLet me write that out: sum up to k is k(k+1)/2, so sum up to k+1 is that sum plus (k+1). So, sum up to k+1 = k(k+1)/2 + (k+1). Hmm, maybe I can factor out (k+1) from both terms. Let's see:\n\nk(k+1)/2 + (k+1) = (k+1)*(k/2 + 1) = (k+1)*(k + 2)/2. Because k/2 + 1 is the same as (k + 2)/2. So that gives me (k+1)(k+2)/2, which is exactly the formula when n = k+1. So that works out.\n\nWait, did I do that correctly? Let me double-check:\n\nStarting with sum up to k+1: S(k+1) = S(k) + (k+1). By the induction hypothesis, S(k) = k(k+1)/2. So S(k+1) = k(k+1)/2 + (k+1). Factor out (k+1): (k+1)(k/2 + 1). Convert 1 to 2/2: (k+1)(k + 2)/2. Which is (k"

    "reasoning_chain": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this logic problem here: If p implies q is true, and q implies r is true, what can we conclude about p implying r? Hmm, okay. I remember something about implications and how they relate to each other. Maybe I can use some rules of inference here.\n\nLet me start by recalling what p \u2192 q and q \u2192 r mean. If p implies q, then whenever p is true, q must also be true. Similarly, if q implies r, then whenever q is true, r must be true. So, putting these together, does that mean p implies r?\n\nWait, let me think about this step by step. Suppose p is true. Then, since p implies q, q must be true. And since q is true, q implies r, so r must also be true. Therefore, if p is true, r is true. That sounds like p implies r.\n\nBut is that the only conclusion? Let me see if there's any possibility where p is true but r is false. If p implies q and q implies r, then whenever p is true, r must be true. So, no, there's no case where p is true and r is false. Therefore, p does imply r.\n\nIs there a way to represent this using logical equivalences or rules? I think the hypothetical syllogism might be relevant here. Hypothetical syllogism states that if p implies q and q implies r, then p implies r. That seems exactly what's happening here.\n\nLet me write this out more formally. We have:\n\n1. p \u2192 q (given)\n2. q \u2192 r (given)\n\nBy hypothetical syllogism, we can conclude:\n\n3. p \u2192 r\n\nSo, that seems to make sense. But just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me consider some truth tables or specific examples.\n\nLet's take p, q, r as propositions with truth values. If p is true, q must be true because of p \u2192 q. Then, since q is true, r must be true because of q \u2192 r. So in all cases where p is true, r is also true, which means p \u2192 r is a tautology, i.e., always true.\n\nWhat if p is false? Then p \u2192 q is still true regardless of q's truth value.

Then, I have to determine which of these are logically equivalent to the original statement. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what each of these terms means. I remember that in logic, given a conditional statement, we can form related statements like contrapositive, converse, and inverse. Let me try to remember how each is constructed.\n\nThe original statement is: If P, then Q. So, in logical terms, that's P \u2192 Q.\n\nNow, the contrapositive. From what I recall, the contrapositive swaps the hypothesis and conclusion and negates both. So, if the original is P \u2192 Q, the contrapositive should be ~Q \u2192 ~P. Wait, is that right? Let me make sure. Yeah, because contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. So, if it's not raining, then the ground is not wet. Hmm, that makes sense.\n\nNext, the converse. I think the converse is just swapping P and Q without negating. So, if the original is P \u2192 Q, the converse is Q \u2192 P. So, in this case, the converse would be: If the ground is wet, then it is raining. Hmm, okay. But is the converse logically equivalent to the original statement? I don't think so. Because the original is about the cause and effect, while the converse is kind of the reverse, which might not always hold. For example, someone could have wet ground because they watered their lawn, not necessarily because it's raining. So, the converse isn't necessarily true, but is it equivalent? No, not in this case.\n\nNow, the inverse. I think the inverse is negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion of the original statement. So, if the original is P \u2192 Q, then the inverse would be ~P \u2192 ~Q. So, in this case, that would be: If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet. Hmm, wait a minute. Is that the inverse?

Hmm, that seems a bit abstract at first glance, but maybe if I break it down, it'll make more sense.\n\nLet me start by recalling what some of these operations mean. The intersection of two sets, like A \u2229 B, consists of all elements that are in both A and B. The union of two sets, A \u222a B, consists of all elements that are in either A or B or both. So, the left side of the equation is taking the intersection of A with B, and then taking the union of that result with the intersection of A and C. The right side is taking the union of B and C first and then intersecting that with A.\n\nI wonder if I can approach this by considering an element and seeing where it can be in each part of the equation. Sometimes, working with elements helps me visualize set operations better.\n\nLet me think: if I take an arbitrary element x, where can x be?\n\nFirst, let's consider the left-hand side: (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C). For x to be in this set, it must be in either A \u2229 B or A \u2229 C. So, x is in A \u2229 B means x is in both A and B. Similarly, x is in A \u2229 C means x is in both A and C. So, for x to be in the left-hand side, x must be in A, and also x must be in either B or C. That is, x is in A and (x is in B or x is in C). So, in logical terms, x \u2208 A \u2227 (x \u2208 B \u2228 x \u2208 C).\n\nNow, what about the right-hand side: A \u2229 (B \u222a C). For x to be in this set, x must be in both A and (B \u222a C).

    "reasoning_chain": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to prove that \u221a2 is irrational using proof by contradiction. Hmm, I remember that irrational numbers are numbers which cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers, right? So, if \u221a2 were rational, that would mean it can be written as a fraction a/b where a and b are integers and b is not zero. But since \u221a2 is irrational, that can't be the case. So, maybe I can assume the opposite and then show that this leads to a contradiction.\n\nAlright, let's start by assuming the opposite of what we want to prove. That is, let's suppose that \u221a2 is rational. If it is rational, then it can be written as a fraction a/b where a and b are integers with no common factors other than 1 (because if they had common factors, we could simplify the fraction). So, I can write:\n\n\u221a2 = a/b\n\nwhere a and b are coprime integers (they have no common divisors other than 1) and b is positive. Now, if I square both sides of this equation, I should get:\n\n(\u221a2)^2 = (a/b)^2\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n2 = a\u00b2 / b\u00b2\n\nThen, multiplying both sides by b\u00b2 gives:\n\n2b\u00b2 = a\u00b2\n\nSo, 2 times b squared equals a squared. Hmm, this implies that a\u00b2 is even because it's 2 times something. If a\u00b2 is even, then a must also be even. Because if you square an odd number, you get an odd number, right? For example, 3\u00b2 is 9, which is odd. So, if a is even, then a can be written as 2k, where k is some integer.\n\nLet me substitute a with 2k in the equation 2b\u00b2 = a\u00b2:\n\n2b\u00b2 = (2k)\u00b2\n2b\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2\n\nNow, dividing both sides by 2:\n\nb\u00b2 = 2k\u00b2\n\nSo, b squared equals 2 times k squared. This implies that b\u00b2 is even, and therefore b is also even because the square of an odd number is odd.

    "reasoning_chain": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to prove that if n squared is even, then n is even. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that numbers can be classified as even or odd, and squares can have different properties based on the number being squared. Maybe I should start by recalling some definitions.\n\nAn even number is any integer that can be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder. On the other hand, an odd number is an integer that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2. So, if n is even, then n can be written as 2k for some integer k. If n is odd, then it can be written as 2k + 1 for some integer k.\n\nThe problem says that if n squared is even, then n must be even. So, let's assume that n squared is even. That means n\u00b2 is divisible by 2. I need to see if this necessarily implies that n is even.\n\nI think I can approach this by contradiction. Assume the opposite: suppose that n is odd. If n is odd, then it can be written as 2k + 1. Then n squared would be (2k + 1) squared. Let me compute that.\n\n(2k + 1)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1. Hmm, this simplifies to 4k(k + 1) + 1. Now, k(k + 1) is the product of two consecutive integers, so one of them must be even. Therefore, k(k + 1) is even, which means that 4k(k + 1) is divisible by 8. So, the entire expression becomes 8m + 1 for some integer m.\n\nTherefore, if n is odd, then n squared is of the form 8m + 1, which is an odd number. But wait, the problem states that n squared is even. So, if n squared is even, our assumption that n is odd leads us to a contradiction because an odd number squared can't be even. Therefore, our initial assumption must be wrong, which means that n must be even.\n\nWait, let me double-check this. If n is odd, then n\u00b2 is odd. So, if n\u00b2 is even, n cannot be odd.

Therefore, I studied.\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in logic, arguments are made up of premises and a conclusion. The premises are the statements that provide the information, and the conclusion is what we're trying to conclude based on those premises. So in this case, the first part, \"If I study, I will pass the exam,\" is a conditional statement. That can be written symbolically as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"I study\" and Q is \"I will pass the exam.\"\n\nThe second premise is \"I passed the exam,\" which is Q. Then the conclusion is \"I studied,\" which is P.\n\nSo the structure of the argument is: P \u2192 Q, Q, therefore P. Hmm, that seems a bit off. I think I've heard of this kind of structure before. Maybe it's a common logical fallacy. Let me think. Oh right, this is called the \"denial of the antecedent\" fallacy. \n\nWait, no, actually, the denial of the antecedent is when you say if P then Q, but P didn't happen, so Q didn't happen. That's not exactly this case. Here, we have P \u2192 Q, Q is true, and we're trying to conclude P is true. So maybe it's another fallacy.\n\nI think it's called the \"affirming the consequent.\" Yes, that's right. The affirming the consequent fallacy occurs when you have a conditional statement P \u2192 Q, and then you affirm Q, and then you conclude P. But that's not a valid deduction because Q can be true even if P is false. So just because I passed the exam doesn't necessarily mean I studied. Maybe I studied, or maybe I used other methods or cheated, or maybe I got lucky.\n\nTo put it another way, the conditional statement P \u2192 Q doesn't imply that P is the only way for Q to be true. There could be other reasons for Q being true.

Let me start by recalling what a truth table is. It's a table that shows all possible truth values of the individual propositions in a statement and then shows the truth value of the entire statement for each combination. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the propositions involved here. The statement is (p \u2192 q) \u2227 (\u00acq \u2192 \u00acp). So, the propositions are p, q.

They can be positive, negative, or zero. Consecutive integers mean numbers that come one after the other without any gaps. So, if I have an integer n, the next one would be n + 1. So, the two consecutive integers would be n and n + 1.\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of these two, which is n + (n + 1). Let me write that out: n + (n + 1) = 2n + 1. Hmm, okay, so the sum simplifies to 2n + 1. I wonder if that helps. \n\nWait, 2n is always an even number because it's a multiple of 2, right? And then we add 1 to it. So, if 2n is even, then 2n + 1 would be odd because adding 1 to an even number makes it odd. Yeah, that makes sense. \n\nBut let me think about this another way to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Then, I have to show that (k + 1)! > 2^(k + 1).\n\nLet me express (k + 1)! in terms of k!. I know that (k + 1)! = (k + 1) \u00d7 k!. So, substituting the inductive hypothesis into this, I can write (k + 1)! = (k + 1) \u00d7 k! > (k + 1) \u00d7 2\u1d4f. So, that simplifies to (k + 1)! > (k + 1) \u00d7 2\u1d4f.\n\nNow, I need to show that this is greater than 2^(k + 1). So, I have (k + 1)! > (k + 1) \u00d7 2\u1d4f, and I need to show that this is greater than 2^(k + 1). Therefore, if I can show that (k + 1) \u00d7 2\u1d4f > 2^(k + 1), then (k + 1)! > 2^(k + 1) will follow.\n\nLet me factor out 2\u1d4f from both sides of the inequality I need to show: (k + 1"

Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what it means for one set to be a subset of another. If A is a subset of B, that means every element in A is also in B. Similarly, if B is a subset of C, every element in B is also in C. So, putting these together, if every element in A is in B, and every element in B is in C, then can I say that every element in A is also in C?\n\nLet me try to break it down with some examples. Maybe concrete examples will help me see if the statement holds or if there are counterexamples where it fails.\n\nLet's say A = {1}, B = {1, 2}, and C = {2, 3}. So, A is a subset of B because 1 is in both. B is a subset of C because all elements of B (which are 1 and 2) are also in C. Wait, no, hold on. 1 is not in C. So, actually, in this case, B is not a subset of C. Hmm, that was a mistake. Let me correct that.\n\nLet me pick A = {1}, B = {1, 2}, and C = {1, 2, 3}. So, A is a subset of B because 1 is in both. B is a subset of C because every element in B is in C. Then, A is also a subset of C because 1 is in both. So, that works.\n\nAnother example: Let A = {a, b}, B = {a, b, c}, and C = {a, c}. Here, A is a subset of B because all elements of A are in B. B is a subset of C because every element in B is in C? Wait, no. Because 'b' is in B but not in C. So again, B is not a subset of C.

    "reasoning_chain": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to express the statement \"Some integers are both even and greater than 10\" using quantifiers and logical symbols. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in logic, when we want to say that some elements have certain properties, we use the existential quantifier, which is written as \u2203. This means \"there exists.\" So, I'll need to start with that.\n\nNext, the statement mentions integers, so I should probably start with \u2200 or \u2203, but since it's about some integers, it's definitely going to be an existential statement. So, it'll be something like \u2203x.\n\nNow, the properties of the integers are being both even and greater than 10. So, I need to translate \"even\" and \"greater than 10\" into logical expressions.\n\nAn integer x is even if there exists another integer y such that x = 2y. But maybe a simpler way is to use the standard notation for even numbers. I think it's commonly represented as x is even, which can be written as Even(x). Similarly, greater than 10 can be written as GT10(x), where GT stands for greater than.\n\nSo, putting that together, the statement \"Some integers are both even and greater than 10\" would be \u2203x (Even(x) \u2227 GT10(x)). The \u2227 here represents the logical conjunction, meaning both conditions must be true.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The original statement is about integers, so do I need to specify that x is an integer? Hmm, in the context of logic, sometimes the domain is implicitly understood. So, if we're working within the domain of integers, we might not need to specify that explicitly. So, the statement would be as I wrote: \u2203x (Even(x) \u2227 GT10(x)).\n\nLet me think if there's another way to write this. Could it be written with a universal quantifier instead? No, because it's about some integers, not all. So, \u2203 is correct.\n\nIs there a more formal way to write Even(x)? I think Even(x) is acceptable, but sometimes it's written as x is even, which can be expressed as \u2203y (x = 2y). But in this case, since we're already using quantifiers, it's probably better to use the standard notation Even(x).\n\nSimilarly"

Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that odd integers can be written in the form 2m + 1, where m is an integer. So, maybe if I square that, I can see what happens. Let me write that down.\n\nLet n be an odd integer. Then, n can be expressed as n = 2m + 1, where m is an integer. Now, if I square both sides, I get n\u00b2 = (2m + 1)\u00b2.\n\nExpanding the right side, I remember that (a + b)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2, so applying that here:\n\nn\u00b2 = (2m)\u00b2 + 2*(2m)*(1) + 1\u00b2\nn\u00b2 = 4m\u00b2 + 4m + 1\n\nOkay, so n\u00b2 is equal to 4m\u00b2 + 4m + 1. Now, I need to see if this can be written in the form 8k + 1. Let me factor out the 4 from the first two terms:\n\nn\u00b2 = 4(m\u00b2 + m) + 1\n\nHmm, so now I have 4 times something plus 1. Let me look at the term inside the parentheses: m\u00b2 + m. I wonder if I can factor that or express it in a way that relates to 8.\n\nWait, m\u00b2 + m can be rewritten as m(m + 1). That's interesting because m and m + 1 are consecutive integers, so one of them must be even. In fact, their product is always even because in any two consecutive integers, one is even and one is odd. So m(m + 1) is even, which means it's equal to 2k for some integer k.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nm(m + 1) = 2k\n\nTherefore, plugging that back into the expression for n\u00b2:\n\nn\u00b2 = 4*(2k) + 1\nn\u00b2 = 8k + 1\n\nOh!

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the original statement to make it clearer. The statement is: For all real numbers x, if x\u00b2 > 4, then x > 2 or x < -2. In logical terms, this can be written as:\n\n\u2200x \u2208 \u211d, (x\u00b2 > 4 \u2192 (x > 2 \u2228 x < -2)).\n\nAlright, so the original statement is a universal statement because it starts with \"for all real numbers x.\" It also has an implication: if x squared is greater than 4, then x is either greater than 2 or less than -2. \n\nNow, I need to find the negation of this statement. Remember, the negation of a universal statement is an existential statement. That is, \u00ac\u2200x P(x) is equivalent to \u2203x \u00acP(x). So, applying that here, the negation would be: There exists a real number x such that the implication (x\u00b2 > 4 \u2192 (x > 2 \u2228 x < -2)) is false.\n\nBut wait, how do I negate an implication? I recall that an implication P \u2192 Q is equivalent to \u00acP \u2228 Q. So, the negation of P \u2192 Q is P \u2227 \u00acQ. That means the implication is false exactly when P is true and Q is false. \n\nSo, applying that to our implication, the negation of (x\u00b2 > 4 \u2192 (x > 2 \u2228 x < -2)) is: x\u00b2 > 4 and it is not the case that (x > 2 \u2228 x < -2). \n\nHmm, but if x\u00b2 > 4, then x must satisfy either x > 2 or x < -2 because x\u00b2 > 4 implies that |x| > 2. So, if x\u00b2 > 4, then x has to be either greater than 2 or less than -2. Therefore, if x\u00b2 > 4, then x > 2 \u2228 x < -2 is always true. \n\nWait a minute, does that mean that"

In symbols, that's (A \u222a B)' = A' \u2229 B'. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in set theory, the complement of a set A, denoted A', consists of all elements not in A. Similarly, B' is all elements not in B. So, (A \u222a B)' should be all elements not in A \u222a B, right? And A' \u2229 B' would be all elements that are not in A and not in B. At first glance, it seems like these two should be the same because if an element isn't in A or B, it's also not in either one individually.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should probably use some logical laws or set identities to formalize this. I recall De Morgan's Laws, which deal with complements of unions and intersections. Specifically, De Morgan's Laws state that the complement of a union is the intersection of the complements, and the complement of an intersection is the union of the complements. So, (A \u222a B)' = A' \u2229 B' is exactly one of De Morgan's Laws. But maybe the question expects me to prove it from more fundamental principles rather than just stating De Morgan's Law.\n\nAlright, let me try to derive it step by step. Let's consider an arbitrary element x. We need to show that x \u2208 (A \u222a B)' if and only if x \u2208 A' \u2229 B'.\n\nFirst, let's recall what (A \u222a B)' means. It's the set of all elements not in A \u222a B. So, x \u2208 (A \u222a B)' means that x is not in A \u222a B. Which means x is not in A and x is not in B. Because if x were in either A or B, it would be in A \u222a B.

The argument goes like this: If x is divisible by 6, then x is divisible by 2 and x is divisible by 3. Then it states that x is divisible by 2 and x is divisible by 3. Therefore, x is divisible by 6. Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that divisibility by 6 is related to both 2 and 3. Specifically, a number is divisible by 6 if and only if it's divisible by both 2 and 3. So, that seems like a fundamental property of numbers. But let me think about how this applies in terms of logic.\n\nThe argument is presented in a syllogistic form. It starts with a conditional statement: If x is divisible by 6, then x is divisible by 2 and x is divisible by 3. Let me represent this in logical terms. Let me denote:\n\nP: x is divisible by 6.\n\nQ: x is divisible by 2.\n\nR: x is divisible by 3.\n\nSo, the first statement is P \u2192 (Q \u2227 R). That's a bit unusual because typically, in logic, the conclusion is a single proposition, not a conjunction. So, usually, a syllogism is like P \u2192 Q, then Q \u2192 R, so P \u2192 R. But here, instead of having P \u2192 Q, it's P \u2192 (Q \u2227 R). That might complicate things a bit.\n\nBut moving on, the next part of the argument says, \"x is divisible by 2 and x is divisible by 3.\" So that's (Q \u2227 R).

So, n\u00b2 - n + 41 \u2261 0 mod 41 should never be true for any integer n. \n\nI remember that in modular arithmetic, if we can show that the quadratic equation n\u00b2 - n + 41 \u2261 0 mod 41 has no solutions, then that would mean n\u00b2 - n + 41 is never divisible by 41. So maybe I can approach this by looking at the equation modulo 41 and see if it has any roots.\n\nLet me write down the equation: n\u00b2 - n + 41 \u2261 0 mod 41. Since 41 \u2261 0 mod 41, the equation simplifies to n\u00b2 - n \u2261 0 mod 41. So, n\u00b2 - n \u2261 0 mod 41. That can be factored as n(n - 1) \u2261 0 mod 41. \n\nNow, in modulo 41, 41 is a prime number, which means it has no zero divisors. So, for the product n(n - 1) to be congruent to 0 mod 41, either n \u2261 0 mod 41 or n - 1 \u2261 0 mod 41. So, n must be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 41. \n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So if n is 0 or 1 modulo 41, then n\u00b2 - n would be divisible by 41. But the original expression is n\u00b2 - n + 41, so adding 41 would still keep it divisible by 41, right?

Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that in logic, two statements are equivalent if they have the same truth table. So maybe the best way to show this is by constructing truth tables for both statements and showing that they are identical.\n\nFirst, let me recall what each statement means. The statement p \u2192 (q \u2192 r) can be read as \"If p then (if q then r)\". So, if p is true, then whatever q and r are, q implies r must hold. On the other hand, the statement (p \u2227 q) \u2192 r is \"If both p and q are true, then r must be true\".

Let me try to recall and figure it out step by step.\n\nAlright, the idea is to assume the opposite of what we want to prove. So, if we assume that there are only finitely many prime numbers, let's say there are primes p\u2081, p\u2082, p\u2083, ..., p\u2099. Then, we need to find a contradiction from this assumption.\n\nOkay, so if there are only finitely many primes, we can list them all out. That makes sense because if it's finite, we can enumerate them. Then, the next step is to consider the smallest prime in this list, right? Let's call that p. Now, I think we need to construct a number by multiplying all these primes together and then adding one. So, the number would be p\u2081p\u2082...p\u2099 + 1. Let me write that down.\n\nLet N = p\u2081p\u2082...p\u2099 + 1.\n\nNow, the crucial part is to show that N is either a new prime or a composite number that isn't divisible by any of the primes in our list. If N is prime, then that contradicts our assumption that p\u2081 through p\u2099 are all the primes. If N is composite, then it must have a prime factor, and that prime factor can't be in our original list because we multiplied all of them together. Therefore, either way, we get a contradiction.\n\nWait, let me make sure I understand why N can't be divisible by any of the primes p\u2081 to p\u2099. If N were divisible by, say, p\u2081, then p\u2081 would divide N. But N is p\u2081p\u2082...p\u2099 + 1, so when we divide N by p\u2081, the remainder would be 1.

Hmm, I've heard about induction before, but I'm not entirely sure how it works. Let me try to recall. \n\nFrom what I remember, mathematical induction has two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. The base case is where you prove the statement is true for the initial value, usually n=1. Then, the inductive step is where you assume it's true for some arbitrary positive integer k, and then prove it must also be true for k+1. \n\nSo, let me start with the base case. For n=1, I need to check if 2\u00b9 > 1. Calculating 2\u00b9 is 2, and 2 is indeed greater than 1. So, the base case holds. That was straightforward.\n\nNow, moving on to the inductive step. I need to assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k. That is, I'll assume that 2\u1d4f > k. This is my induction hypothesis. \n\nThe next part is to prove that 2\u1d4f\u207a\u00b9 > k+1. To do this, I should try to express 2\u1d4f\u207a\u00b9 in terms of 2\u1d4f. I know that 2\u1d4f\u207a\u00b9 is equal to 2 * 2\u1d4f. So, let me write that down: 2\u1d4f\u207a\u00b9 = 2 * 2\u1d4f.\n\nNow, from my induction hypothesis, I know that 2\u1d4f > k. If I multiply both sides of this inequality by 2, which is a positive number, the direction of the inequality should remain the same. So, multiplying both sides by 2 gives me 2 * 2\u1d4f > 2 * k, which simplifies to 2\u1d4f\u207a\u00b9 > 2k.\n\nAlright, so now I have that 2\u1d4f\u207a\u00b9 > 2k.

Therefore, 1\u00b2 = 1, so the inequality 1\u00b2 \u2265 1 is true.\n\nNext, n = 2:\nn\u00b2 = 2\u00b2 = 4\nHere, 4 is greater than 2, so 4 \u2265 2 is true.\n\nn = 3:\n3\u00b2 = 9\n9 is greater than 3, so 9 \u2265 3 is true.\n\nn = 4:\n4\u00b2 = 16\n16 is greater than 4, so 16 \u2265 4 is true.\n\nWait, so far, for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, the inequality holds. Hmm, is this always the case?\n\nWait a second, what about n = 0? But hold on, the statement says \"for all positive integers n.\" So, n starts from 1, right? Because positive integers are 1, 2, 3, and so on. So n = 0 is not included here. Okay, so we don't need to check n = 0.\n\nWait, but just out of curiosity, if n = 0, n\u00b2 = 0, and 0 \u2265 0 is true. But since the statement is about positive integers, we can ignore n = 0.\n\nNow, let's think about n = 1. We saw that n\u00b2 = 1, which is equal to n."

    "reasoning_chain": "<think>\nAlright, so I have to prove that the statement \"(p \u2192 q) \u2192 p\" is not a tautology. Hmm, okay. Let me think about this step by step. First, I need to remember what a tautology is. If I recall correctly, a tautology in logic is a statement that is always true, no matter what truth values its propositional variables take. So, if I can show that there's at least one scenario where \"(p \u2192 q) \u2192 p\" is false, then it's not a tautology. That makes sense.\n\nAlright, so let me break down the statement: \"(p \u2192 q) \u2192 p\". Let's parse this out. The outer implication is \"(p \u2192 q) \u2192 p\", which can be read as \"If (p implies q), then p\". Wait, that seems a bit confusing. So, if p implies q, then p must be true? That doesn't immediately seem obviously true or false, which is probably why someone would ask if it's a tautology or not.\n\nMaybe I should construct a truth table to check all possible truth values of p and q and see if the statement is always true. That sounds like a solid approach. Let me list out all possible combinations of p and q.\n\nSo, p can be either true (T) or false (F), and q can be T or F. That gives us four cases:\n\n1. p = T, q = T\n2. p = T, q = F\n3. p = F, q = T\n4. p = F, q = F\n\nLet me evaluate the statement \"(p \u2192 q) \u2192 p\" for each of these cases.\n\nStarting with the first case: p = T, q = T.\n\nSo, (p \u2192 q) is T because if p is T, then p \u2192 q is T regardless of q. Then, we have (T \u2192 p), which is (T \u2192 T), which is T. So, the whole statement is T in this case.\n\nSecond case: p = T, q = F.\n\nHere, (p \u2192 q) is F because p is T and q is F, so p \u2192 q is F. Then, we have (F \u2192 p), which is (F \u2192 T). In logic, an implication with a false antecedent is always true. So, F \u2192 T is T. Therefore,"

    "reasoning_chain": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this argument is valid. Let me break it down step by step. The argument goes like this: If it is sunny, then we go to the beach. If we go to the beach, then we swim. We did not swim. Therefore, it was not sunny.\n\nHmm, first, I think I need to understand the structure of the argument. It seems like it's using conditional statements. In logic, conditional statements are of the form \"If P, then Q.\" So, let me assign P, Q, and R to each part.\n\nLet me define:\n- P: It is sunny.\n- Q: We go to the beach.\n- R: We swim.\n\nSo the argument translates to:\n1. If P, then Q. (If it's sunny, we go to the beach.)\n2. If Q, then R. (If we go to the beach, we swim.)\n3. We did not swim. (\u00acR)\n4. Therefore, it was not sunny. (\u00acP)\n\nNow, I need to determine if this argument is valid. In logic, a valid argument is one where if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. So, let's see.\n\nFirst, let's check the premises. The first premise is P \u2192 Q. That means if it's sunny, we go to the beach. The second premise is Q \u2192 R, meaning if we go to the beach, we swim. Now, the third statement given is \u00acR, which is \"we did not swim.\"\n\nSo, if we assume the premises are true, can we conclude that \u00acP (it was not sunny) must be true?\n\nLet me think about this. If it's sunny (P), we go to the beach (Q). If we go to the beach, we swim (R). So, if it's sunny, we swim. But we didn't swim (\u00acR). Therefore, it can't be sunny, because if it were, we would have swum. So, the conclusion follows.\n\nWait, but is there a possibility that it's not sunny, and we still went to the beach? The first premise only says that if it's sunny, we go to the beach. It doesn't say that we only go to the beach when it's sunny. So, maybe even if it's not sunny, we could still decide to go to the beach for"

    "reasoning_chain": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to prove that for any integers a and b, if a squared plus b squared is odd, then exactly one of a or b is odd. Hmm, let me think about how squares behave with even and odd numbers.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you square an even number, the result is even, and when you square an odd number, the result is odd. Let me write that down:\n\n- If a is even, then a\u00b2 is even.\n- If a is odd, then a\u00b2 is odd.\n\nSame goes for b.\n\nSo, the sum a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 is odd. Let me recall that the sum of two numbers is odd only if one is even and the other is odd. Because even + odd = odd, and odd + even = odd. If both are even, even + even = even, and if both are odd, odd + odd = even. So, yeah, that seems right.\n\nSo, if a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 is odd, then one of a\u00b2 or b\u00b2 must be even, and the other must be odd. Because if both were even, their sum would be even, and if both were odd, their sum would also be even. So, only one can be even, and the other must be odd.\n\nWait, so that means one of a or b is odd, and the other is even. Because a\u00b2 is even only if a is even, and a\u00b2 is odd only if a is odd. So, if a\u00b2 is even, then a must be even, and if a\u00b2 is odd, then a must be odd.\n\nSo, putting it all together, if a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 is odd, then exactly one of a or b is odd. The other must be even.\n\nLet me check this with some examples to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nCase 1: Let a = 2 (even), b = 3 (odd). Then a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 4 + 9 = 13, which is odd. So that works.\n\nCase 2: a = 3 (odd), b = 4 (even). a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 9 + 16 = 25, which is odd. Also works.\n\nCase 3: a = 2 (even), b = 2 (even). a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 4 + 4 = 8, which is even"

    "reasoning_chain": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to use the well-ordering principle to prove that every positive integer can be expressed as a product of prime numbers. Hmm, I remember the well-ordering principle is also known as the principle of infinite descent, right? It states that if you have a set that is well-ordered, meaning every non-empty subset has a least element, then there can't be an infinite descending chain of elements. So, if you have a sequence where each term is smaller than the previous one, it can't go on forever.\n\nAlright, so how does this apply to proving that every positive integer is a product of primes? Well, I think this is related to the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, which says that every integer greater than 1 can be represented uniquely as a product of prime numbers, up to the order. So, primes are the building blocks, so to speak.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove it using the well-ordering principle. So, maybe I need to approach it by contradiction or something. Let me think.\n\nSuppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a positive integer that cannot be expressed as a product of prime numbers. Let's call this integer N. If N is 1, well, 1 is a unit, not a prime, but the problem says positive integer, so maybe 1 is allowed? Hmm, but 1 cannot be expressed as a product of primes because there are no primes in the product. So, is 1 considered here? Maybe the problem assumes N is greater than 1? Or maybe it's considering 1 as a trivial case.\n\nWait, the original problem says every positive integer, so including 1. Hmm, but 1 isn't a product of primes because primes are greater than 1, and you need at least one prime to make a product, but 1 is just 1. So, maybe the problem is actually about integers greater than 1? Or maybe I need to adjust my approach.\n\nWait, no. Let me read the problem again: \"every positive integer can be expressed as a product of prime numbers.\" So, 1 is a positive integer, but it cannot be expressed as a product of primes.

    "reasoning_chain": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to prove that for any sets A, B, and C, the set difference A minus (B intersection C) is equal to (A minus B) union (A minus C). Hmm, let's start by recalling what these set operations mean.\n\nFirst, A minus (B \u2229 C) means all elements that are in A but not in both B and C. In other words, elements that are in A but are not in B or not in C. On the other hand, (A - B) \u222a (A - C) means all elements that are in A but not in B, or in A but not in C. So intuitively, these should be the same because if an element is in A and not in both B and C, it must be in A but not in B or not in C. But I guess I need to formalize this.\n\nMaybe I can use Venn diagrams to visualize this. Let me imagine three overlapping circles representing sets A, B, and C. The intersection B \u2229 C would be the overlapping area between B and C. So A minus (B \u2229 C) would include all parts of A that are outside of B \u2229 C, which would be the parts of A that are not in B or not in C.\n\nSimilarly, (A - B) is all of A except the part that overlaps with B, and (A - C) is all of A except the part that overlaps with C. When I take the union of these two, I'm combining all elements that are in A but not in B and all elements that are in A but not in C. So, if I look at the union, it should cover all the parts of A that are outside of B or outside of C, which is exactly what A - (B \u2229 C) is. So, this seems to make sense visually.\n\nBut to make it more rigorous, maybe I can use set theory axioms or definitions. I remember that set difference can be defined using union and intersection. Specifically, A - B is equal to A \u2229 B^c, where B^c is the complement of B. Similarly, A - C is A \u2229 C^c.\n\nSo, let's rewrite both sides of the equation using complement notation. The left side is A - (B \u2229 C). Using the complement, this would be A \u2229 (B \u2229 C"

I need to figure out if this argument is valid by constructing a truth table. Hmm, okay, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that a truth table is a way to check all possible combinations of truth values for the propositions involved. In this case, the propositions are p, q, r, and s. So, each of these can be either true (T) or false (F). Since there are four propositions, there are 2^4 = 16 possible combinations. That's manageable.\n\nNow, let's list out the premises and the conclusion one by one:\n\n1. If p, then q. (I'll write this as p \u2192 q)\n2. If not p, then r. (Which is \u00acp \u2192 r)\n3. If q, then s. (So, q \u2192 s)\n4. Therefore, if not r, then s. (Which is \u00acr \u2192 s)\n\nOur goal is to see if these premises necessarily lead to the conclusion. So, I need to construct a truth table where the premises are true, and then check if the conclusion must also be true in all those cases.\n\nLet me start by setting up the columns for each proposition: p, q, r, s, \u00acp, \u00acq, \u00acr, \u00acs. Then, I'll compute the truth values for each premise and the conclusion based on all possible combinations.\n\nI think it might help to structure this systematically. I'll go through each possible value of p first, then q, r, and s, and compute the necessary implications.\n\nBut wait, maybe a better approach is to iterate through all 16 combinations systematically. Let me number them from 1 to 16.\n\nBefore I proceed, I should recall how implications work in truth tables. Remember, p \u2192 q is equivalent to \u00acp \u2228 q. Similarly, \u00acp \u2192 r is \u00ac\u00acp \u2228 r, which simplifies to p \u2228 r. Q \u2192 s is \u00acq \u2228 s, and \u00acr \u2192 s is \u00ac\u00acr \u2228 s, which is r \u2228 s.\n\nSo, if I can compute these equivalences, maybe the truth table will be clearer.\n\nLet me create a table with headers: p, q, r, s"

    "reasoning_chain": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem: I need to prove that if n is a positive integer, then n is a perfect square if and only if the number of its divisors is odd. Hmm, okay. Let me try to wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst off, let me recall what a perfect square is. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as some integer squared, right? So, like 1, 4, 9, 16, and so on. That means that in its prime factorization, every exponent has to be even. For example, 36 is 6 squared, which is 2 squared times 3 squared. So, the exponents 2 and 2 are both even.\n\nNow, the problem is saying that n is a perfect square if and only if the number of its divisors is odd. Hmm, okay. So, I need to prove both directions: if n is a perfect square, then it has an odd number of divisors, and conversely, if a number has an odd number of divisors, then it must be a perfect square.\n\nLet me start with the first direction: if n is a perfect square, then the number of its divisors is odd.\n\nOkay, so suppose n is a perfect square. Then, as I mentioned, its prime factorization has all even exponents. Let me write this down. Let n = p1^k1 * p2^k2 * ... * pn^kn, where each ki is even, say ki = 2mi for some integers mi. Then, the number of divisors of n is given by the product of (ki + 1) for each prime pi. So, the number of divisors would be (2m1 + 1)(2m2 + 1)...(2mn + 1). Each of these terms is odd because 2mi + 1 is always odd, right? So, multiplying a bunch of odd numbers together gives an odd number. Therefore, the number of divisors is odd. Okay, that seems straightforward.\n\nNow, for the converse: if a number has an odd number of divisors, then it must be a perfect square. Hmm, this seems trickier. So, suppose that n has an odd number of divisors. I need to show that n is a perfect square.\n\nWait, I remember that divisors come in pairs. For"
